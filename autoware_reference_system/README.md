# reference_system_autoware

This file is meant to define the Autoware Reference System and all of its nodes, topics and message types.

![Node graph of reference-system-autoware](../content/img/dotgraph_autoware.svg)

## Message Types

A **single message type** is used for the entire _reference system_ when generating results in order to simplify the setup as well as make it more repeatible and extensible.

This means **only one _message type_** from the list below is used during any given experimental run for every node in the reference system.

1. [**Message4kB**](../reference_interfaces/msg/Message4kB.idl)
    - reference message with a fixed size of 4 kilobytes (kB)

Other messages with different fixed sizes could be added here in the future.

When reporting results it will be important to include the _message type_ used duing the experiement so that comparisons can be done "apples to apples" and not "apples to pears".

## Reference System Autoware

Built from [a handful of building-block node types](../README.md#concept-overview), each one of these nodes are meant to simulate a real-world node from the Autoware.Auto project lidar data pipeline.

Under each node type are the requirements used for _this specific reference system_, `reference_system_autoware`. Future reference systems could have slightly different requirements and still use the same building-block node types.

For simplicity's sake, every node except for the _command nodes_ only ever publishes one topic and this topic has the same name as the node that publishes it. However, each topic can be subscribed to by multiple different nodes.

1. [**Message Type**](#message-types)
    - all nodes use the same message type during any single test run
    - default _message type_:
